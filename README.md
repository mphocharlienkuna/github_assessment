### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mphocharlienkuna/github_assessment.git
    cd github_assessment
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Ensure Flutter is set up:
    ```bash

2. Add your GitHub API key or other configurations in the `.env` file:
    ```
    GITHUB_TOKEN=your_api_key_here
    ```

### Database Setup

This app uses Hive to store liked GitHub accounts locally. The necessary Hive boxes are initialized at the start of the app.

- The `AppConstants.likedAccountsBox` box stores liked GitHub accounts.
- The `AppConstants.recentSearchesBox` box stores recent search queries.

## Usage

### Searching for GitHub Users

- The app allows users to search for GitHub users by their username. The search results will show the userâ€™s name, bio, repositories, followers, etc.

### Liking and Unliking Accounts

- Users can like GitHub accounts, which will store their details in the local database (Hive).
- Liked accounts will be displayed in the "Liked Accounts" section of the home screen.
- Users can also unlike accounts, which removes them from the list.

### Viewing Account Details

- Tapping on a user in the search results will navigate to a detailed view of the user's profile, including their repositories.

### Error Handling and Retry Mechanism

- The app includes retry functionality for network requests. If a request fails, the app will retry the request a few times before showing an error message.
- All network-related errors will display user-friendly error messages.
